    <p>(Outside) (The DeLorean lands outside Hilldale - on the No Landing sign! - and Doc gets out.) All right Einie, let's find Jennifer! I don't believe it, I live in Hilldale! This is great! Way to go McFly! Marty, stay here, change clothes, I need you on holler.</p>
    <p>(Main Street) Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. (Marty shows up.) You're late, do you have no concept of time? Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm going back in that zoot suit? The old man really came through it worked. What? He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.</p>
    <p>I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the futureâ€¦ No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. (Coffee Shop) (Marty is writing Doc a letter.) Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.</p>

    <p>Hey Doc. Doc. (grins and waves) (Doc freaks out again, and starts screaming. He trips over the hoverboard trying to get away from Marty and bumps into the piano and ends up sitting on the keys.) Doc, calm down, OK? Just calm down, it's me, it's Marty. No! It can't be you I just sent you back to the future!! But I came back from the future, remember? Last night you fainted... I brought you home.</p>
